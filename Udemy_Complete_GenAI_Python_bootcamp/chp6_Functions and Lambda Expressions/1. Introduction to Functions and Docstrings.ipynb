    "# We use functions to organize our code in blocks that can later be reused.\n",
    "# This offers better readability and modularity for our code.\n",
    "# DRY - DONT REPEAT YOURSELF\n",
    "# Best practice with functions is to use docstrings for documenting the function code\n",
    "# A docstring is a string literal that occurs as \n",
    "# the first statement in a function, module, class or method definiation.\n",
    "# Python functions\n",
    "def my_function(): # Basic structure starts with def (define) function_name and (parameter): with colon\n",
