    "# Opening and Reading Files no need to import a specific model, its handled native in the language\n",
    "# Built-in function open() that opens a file and returns a file object\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "f = open('config.txt') # This line of code creates a file object called f, this \n",
    "# file object contains methods and other attributes that can be used to modify the file you have opened\n",
    "# Use a valid absolute or realitive path accroding to O.S.\n",
    "# An invalid path is the most common mistakes\n",
    "#The 2nd argument which is optional is called access mode and indicates how the file will be opened\n",
    "# The most common used modes are read, write, append\n",
    "f = open('config.txt', 'r') # r is the second argument in read only mode\n",
    "# r is default mode (read only)\n",
    "# There are 2 types of files 1) Text files 2) Binary Files\n",
    "# Text files are structures as a sequence of lines, where each line includes\n",
    "#a sequence of characters that are encoded by default using the UTF-8 encoding scheme.\n",
    "#each line is terminated with a special character, called EOL. THis is coded by using \\n.\n",
    "# Binary files are any type of file that is not a text file. Binary files can only\n",
    "#be processed by an application that knows and understands the structure of the file.\n",
    "# When opening a file using the open function, use t for the 2nd argument text mode\n",
    "#or b to open the file in binary mode.\n",
    "f = open('config.txt', 'rt') # read only in text mode argument\n",
    "# By default it will open as a text file\n",
    "# The file has been opened so now need to read the content of the text file and print it\n",
