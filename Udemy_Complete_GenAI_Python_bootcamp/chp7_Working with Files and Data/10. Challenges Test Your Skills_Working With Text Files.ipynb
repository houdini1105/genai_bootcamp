    "# Chp7 Ep10. Challenges Test Your Skills - Working With Text Files\n",
    "# Challenge #1\n",
    "# You are given a text file that contains multiple duplicate MAC addresses.\n",
    "# Create a Python script that generates a new file containing only unique \n",
    "# MAC addresses, with each address on a separate line.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Challenge #2\n",
    "# Create a Python script that reads a text file into a list, then converts the list into a single string containing the entire file content.\n",
    "# 📁 Click to download a sample text file.\n",
    "# [Stuck? Click here to see the solution.]\n",

    "# Create a Python function called tail that reads the last n lines of a text file.\n",
    "# The function should accept two arguments: the file name and the number of lines to read (n).\n",
    "# This mimics the behavior of the Linux tail command.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# tail('sample_file.txt', 5)\n",
