    "# An operator is a symbol that performs an operation on one or more operands. In Python, operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. Python supports various types of operators, including arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, bitwise, identity, membership, and more.\n",
    "# In Python, numbers can be integers, floats, or complex numbers. You can perform arithmetic\n",
    "# operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using the respective operators. Python also supports operator precedence, which determines the order in which operations are performed.\n",
    "# Numbers and math operators in Python are fundamental concepts that allow you to perform calculations and manipulate numerical data. Python provides a rich set of built-in functions and operators for working with numbers, making it easy to perform mathematical operations.\n",
