    "# Challenge 1: Creating a Dictionary from Lists\n",
    "# Challenge: You have two lists: one for keys and one for values. Create a dictionary from these lists.\n",
    "# keys = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
    "# values = [1.0, 0.5, 2.0]\n",
    "# Your goal is to create a dictionary where\n",
    "#  'apple' maps to 1.0, 'banana' to 0.5, and 'cherry' to 2.0.\n",
    "# Walkthrough:\n",
    "# Python has a built-in function that is perfect for creating a \n",
    "# dictionary from two lists, where one list provides the keys and the \n",
    "# other provides the corresponding values. This function often works well \n",
    "# with another function that combines elements from multiple iterables.\n",
    "# What should you do next?\n",
    "# What built-in functions might you consider using to pair up the items \n",
    "# from the keys and values lists and turn them into a dictionary?\n",
    "keys = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
    "values = [1.0, 0.5, 2.0]\n",
    "my_dict = dict(zip(keys, values))\n",
    "print(my_dict)\n",

    "# Challenge 2: Deleting a Key-Value Pair\n",
    "# Challenge: You have a dictionary of game scores. \n",
    "# Remove the entry for 'PlayerC'.\n",
    "# Python\n",
    "# game_scores = {'PlayerA': 100, 'PlayerB': 150, 'PlayerC': 75}\n",
    "# Walkthrough:\n",
    "# Dictionaries have a keyword that allows you to remove a specific \n",
    "# key-value pair. You use this keyword followed by the dictionary name \n",
    "# and the key you want to remove in square brackets.\n",
    "# What should you do next?\n",
    "# How would you write the line of code to remove 'PlayerC' and its score \n",
    "# from game_scores?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Challenge 3: Combining Dictionaries\n",
    "# Challenge: You have two separate dictionaries representing parts of an inventory. Combine them into a single new dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python\n",
    "\n",
    "# inventory_part1 = {'shirts': 20, 'pants': 15}\n",
    "# inventory_part2 = {'shoes': 10, 'hats': 5}\n",
    "# Create a new dictionary called full_inventory that contains all items from both inventory_part1 and inventory_part2.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Walkthrough:\n",
    "# There are several ways to combine dictionaries. One common way for Python 3.5+ is to use a special unpacking operator (**) which works well when creating a new dictionary. Another method involves using a dictionary's update() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What should you do next?\n",
    "# How would you combine these two dictionaries into full_inventory using the unpacking operator?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Challenge 4: Clearing a Dictionary\n",
    "# Challenge: Empty the following dictionary, removing all its key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python\n",
    "\n",
    "# temp_data = {'sensor_id': 'XYZ001', 'temperature': 25.5, 'humidity': 60}\n",
    "# Walkthrough:\n",
    "# Dictionaries have a built-in method specifically designed to remove all items from them, making them empty. This method doesn't take any arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What should you do next?\n",
    "# What method would you call on temp_data to clear it?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Challenge 5: Iterating Through Key-Value Pairs\n",
    "# Challenge: Print out both the key and the value for each item in the product_prices dictionary, formatted like: \"Product: [key], Price: [value]\".\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python\n",
    "\n",
    "# product_prices = {'laptop': 1200, 'mouse': 25, 'keyboard': 75}\n",
    "# Walkthrough:\n",
    "# When you want to iterate over both the keys and their corresponding values in a dictionary simultaneously, there's a specific dictionary method that returns pairs of (key, value) tuples. You can then unpack these tuples directly in your for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What should you do next?\n",
    "# What dictionary method would you use in your for loop, and how would you structure the print() statement inside the loop?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Challenge 6: Using in for Key Existence Check\n",
    "# Challenge: Check if the key 'email' exists in the user_settings dictionary. Print \"Email setting exists\" if it does, and \"Email setting missing\" otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python\n",
    "\n",
    "# user_settings = {'theme': 'dark', 'notifications': True}\n",
    "# Walkthrough:\n",
    "# Python provides a convenient operator to check for the presence of an element within a collection (like a key in a dictionary). It's typically used in an if statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What should you do next?\n",
    "# How would you write an if/else statement using this operator to perform the check?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Challenge 7: Dictionary Comprehension (Introductory)\n",
    "# Challenge: Create a new dictionary called squared_numbers where the keys are numbers from 1 to 5, and the values are the square of those numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Your final dictionary should look like: {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Walkthrough:\n",
    "# While you could use a for loop, Python offers a more concise way to create dictionaries (and lists, sets) based on existing iterables or a range, called \"dictionary comprehension.\" It looks similar to a for loop but is written within the dictionary's curly braces.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What should you do next?\n",
    "# How would you write this using dictionary comprehension, iterating through a range() of numbers?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Challenge 8: Dictionary with Mixed Value Types\n",
    "# Challenge: Create a dictionary called user_data for a single user. It should contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "# A string for 'username' (e.g., 'john_doe')\n",
    "\n",
    "# an integer for 'id' (e.g., 101)\n",
    "\n",
    "# a boolean for 'is_active' (e.g., True)\n",
    "\n",
    "# a list of strings for 'roles' (e.g., ['admin', 'editor'])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Walkthrough:\n",
    "# This challenge reinforces that dictionary values can be of any data type, including other complex types like lists. You just need to correctly define each key-value pair within the dictionary's curly braces.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What should you do next?\n",
    "# How would you define the user_data dictionary with all these specified key-value pairs?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Challenge 9: Accessing a Value in a Nested List within a Dictionary\n",
    "# Challenge: From the student_grades dictionary, extract and print the grade 'B' for 'Mathematics'.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python\n",
    "\n",
    "# student_grades = {\n",
    "#     'Alice': {'Physics': 85, 'Chemistry': 90, 'Mathematics': [70, 'B']},\n",
    "#     'Bob': {'Physics': 75, 'Chemistry': 80, 'Mathematics': [65, 'C']}\n",
    "# }\n",
    "# Walkthrough:\n",
    "# This requires multiple levels of access. First, you'll need to access the dictionary for 'Alice'. Then, within 'Alice's dictionary, you'll access the value for 'Mathematics', which is a list. Finally, you'll need to access the correct element from that list.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What should you do next?\n",
    "# How would you string together the key and index accesses to get to the 'B' grade?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Challenge 10: Updating Multiple Values at Once\n",
    "# Challenge: The product_stock dictionary needs to have its 'chairs' stock updated to 25 and a new item 'desks' added with a stock of 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python\n",
    "\n",
    "# product_stock = {'tables': 5, 'chairs': 20}\n",
    "# Walkthrough:\n",
    "# While you could do this with two separate assignment statements, dictionaries have a method that allows you to update existing key-value pairs and add new ones from another dictionary or an iterable of key-value pairs. This can be more efficient for multiple changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What should you next?\n",
    "# What method would you use on product_stock to apply both updates in one step?"
