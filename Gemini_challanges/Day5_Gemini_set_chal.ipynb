    "# Challenge 1: Finding Unique Words\n",
    "# Concept: Sets are excellent for identifying unique items from a collection.\n",
    "# Scenario: You have a sentence and you want to find out how many \n",
    "# unique words it contains. The words should be treated as case-insensitive.\n",
    "# Challenge: Create a Python script that takes a string of words, \n",
    "# converts it to a set of unique words (ignoring case), \n",
    "# and prints the number of unique words found.\n",
    "# Walk-through Steps:\n",
    "# Define the initial string: Start with a variable holding a sentence.\n",
    "# Split the string: Break the sentence into a list of individual words.\n",
    "# Convert to a set: Use a set to automatically handle the uniqueness of the words. \n",
    "# You'll need to consider how to handle the case-insensitivity requirement before or during this step.\n",
