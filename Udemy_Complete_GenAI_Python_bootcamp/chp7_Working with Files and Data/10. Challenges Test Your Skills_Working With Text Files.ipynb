    "# Chp7 Ep10. Challenges Test Your Skills - Working With Text Files\n",
    "# Challenge #1\n",
    "# You are given a text file that contains multiple duplicate MAC addresses.\n",
    "# Create a Python script that generates a new file containing only unique \n",
    "# MAC addresses, with each address on a separate line.\n",
    "# Open the file 'macs.txt' for reading with the alias 'f'\n",
    "with open('macs.txt', 'rt') as f:\n",
    "    # Read all lines from the file, split them into a list, and then convert to a set\n",
    "    # The set automatically handles removing any duplicate MAC addresses\n",
    "    new_file = set(f.read().splitlines())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open a new file named 'final_macs.txt' for writing with the alias 'f'\n",
    "with open('final_macs.txt', 'wt') as f:\n",
    "    # Loop through each unique MAC address stored in the 'new_file' set\n",
    "    for mac in new_file:\n",
    "        # Write each MAC address to the new file\n",
    "        # The '\\n' adds a new line after each address, putting each one on its own line\n",
    "        f.write(mac + '\\n')\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Challenge #2\n",
    "# Create a Python script that reads a text file into a list, then converts the list into a single string containing the entire file content.\n",
    "# üìÅ Click to download a sample text file.\n",
    "# [Stuck? Click here to see the solution.]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "# Challenge #3\n",
    "# Write a Python script that removes all empty lines, including lines that contain only spaces, from a text file.\n",

    "# [Stuck? Click here to see the solution.]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Challenge #4\n",
    "# Create a Python function called tail that reads the last n lines of a text file.\n",
    "# The function should accept two arguments: the file name and the number of lines to read (n).\n",
    "# This mimics the behavior of the Linux tail command.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# tail('sample_file.txt', 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Returns the last 5 lines of sample_file.txt.\n",

    "# Challenge #5\n",
    "# Modify the previous solution so that the script automatically refreshes and prints the last n lines of the file every 3 seconds.\n",
    "# This is similar to the Linux tail -f command.\n",
    "# üìÅ Click to download a sample text file.\n",
    "# [Stuck? Click here to see the solution.]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Challenge #6\n",
    "# Write a Python program to count the number of lines, words, and characters in a text file ‚Äî similar to the Linux wc command.\n",

    "# D:50 # Deposit\n",
    "# W:100 # Withdrawal\n",

    "# Write a Python script that counts the occurrence of each letter (A-Z, a-z) in all the words of the dictionary.\n",
    "# Make a distinction between lowercase and uppercase letters.\n",
    "# At the end, identify:\n",
    "\n",
    "# a) The most frequently used letter in the English dictionary\n",
    "# b) The least frequently used letter in the English dictionary\n",
